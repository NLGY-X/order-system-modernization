# üö® CRITICAL ROUTING BUG IDENTIFIED

## The Problem
When navigating to `/admin/products/new`, Nuxt is serving the **wrong component**:
- **Expected**: Add New Product page (`frontend/pages/admin/products/new.vue`)
- **Actually Served**: Products Management page (`frontend/pages/admin/products.vue`)

## Evidence
1. **Route Resolution**: ‚úÖ CORRECT
   - URL: `/admin/products/new`
   - Route Name: `admin-products-new`
   - Middleware: `admin-auth` (working)

2. **Component Served**: ‚ùå WRONG
   - Title: "Products Management - Admin Panel"
   - Content: Products list with "Loading products..." 
   - Should be: "Add New Product - Admin Panel"

## What This Means
- **Buttons ARE working** - routes change correctly
- **Authentication IS working** - middleware executes
- **Problem**: Nuxt's component resolution system is failing

## Possible Causes
1. **File system watcher issue** - dev server not detecting new.vue
2. **Route generation conflict** - Vue Router priority issue
3. **Component import/export issue** - new.vue not properly registered
4. **Nuxt cache corruption** - persisting despite cache clears

## Impact
- Edit buttons: Show products list instead of edit form
- Add button: Shows products list instead of add form
- User sees no visual change, thinks buttons are broken

## Status
This is a **critical Nuxt framework-level issue** that needs deeper investigation into:
- Route generation process
- Component registration
- File system watching
- Vue Router configuration
